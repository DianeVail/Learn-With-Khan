This Project was created to help students easily find resources for solving math problems.  It utilizes the following resources:

 - KhanAcademy.com
 - Desmos
 - Geogebra
 - SchoolYourself.com
 - Numbers API

This project also includes an app to calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle.  

**Goals of this Project**

 - Demonstrate my current knowledge of responsive web design
 - Demonstrate my current knowledge of basic JavaScript functionality
 - Demonstrate my current knowledge of incorporating restful APIs

**Code:YOU Feature Requirements**

1. Create a function that accepts two or more input parameters and returns a value that is calculated or determined by the inputs.  Basic math functions donâ€™t count (e.g. addition, etc)
2. Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.
3. Use a regular expression to validate user input and either prevent the invalid input or inform the user about it (in all cases prevent invalid input from being stored or saved).


**Prerequisites:**

Be sure you have the following installed:

 - Git: Version control system to clone and manage the repository.
 - GitHub: make sure you have an account to sync your repositories to.
 - Code Editor: Any code editor like Visual Studio Code

**Cloning the Repository**

Follow these steps to fork and clone the repository:

 - Open your terminal or Git Bash
 - Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project
 - Fork the repository
 - Clone the forked repository to edit on your local computer

**Viewing the Project**

To view the project locally, you can either open the project files in your code editor or open the HTML files in your browser.

There is a lot of room for growth on this project to include code for calculating perimeter, area, volume and more.
