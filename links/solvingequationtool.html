            <p>A Linear equation can be written in the form y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.</p>
            <p>A Quadratic Equation can be written in the form of ax<sup>2</sup> +bx + c, where a,b,and c are numbers.</p>
            <p>Below, enter the values of a, b, and c.  If your equation is linear, enter a 0 for a and anter the m value in place of b.</p>
